                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Onkar Dhillon, and I'm thrilled to have you here! I am passionate about computers and
                    computer science, diving into programming, algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
                    I am driven by constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in computing, math, and anything that
                    captures my interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in computer science most likely began around 5th grade. I say ‚Äúaround 5th grade‚Äù because that
                    was when I first learned about a cousin who worked with computers. After being fascinated by his interests,
                    my own curiosity in computers began to grow. At that time, it was only a passing thought, something I didn‚Äôt
                    dive into right away. I just knew I liked computers and wanted to do something with them, so my original
                    goal was to pursue Computer Engineering.
                </p>
                <p >
                    That remained my plan until about 7th or 8th grade, when I started experimenting with web development.
                    While some may not consider it ‚Äútrue‚Äù computer science, it was my entry point into the field. I learned
                    the very basics, and after building a mediocre website, I proudly declared myself an ‚Äúexpert.‚Äù Of course,
                    I quickly forgot most of it within the year and then moved on to high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my second year of high school, I rekindled my interest when I joined the robotics team as a
                    founding member. That experience pushed me to take a deeper dive into computer science, and I began
                    learning Java‚Äîfor myself and for my team. It was then that I truly fell in love with the field and decided
                    this was the path I wanted to continue pursuing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm currently focused on web development and taking classes in statistics and data analytics, software
                    engineering, senior seminar, computer and information ethics, and beginning guitar. I will also soon be
                    starting research and writing research papers. I believe in continuous learning, problem-solving, and
                    pursuing knowledge in computing, math, and anything that sparks my curiosity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of computer science, I enjoy snowboarding, playing Magic: The Gathering (still learning),
                    video games, photography, learning guitar, robotics and electronics, watches, CAM/CAD projects,
                    and 3D printing and prototyping.
